  <blockquote>
    <p>A shelter can protect you from the sun, insects, wind, rain, snow, hot or
    cold temperatures, and enemy observation. It can give you a feeling of
    well-being and help you maintain your will to survive.</p>
    <p>In some areas, your need for shelter may take precedence over your need
    for food and possibly even your need for water. For example, prolonged
    exposure to cold can cause excessive fatigue and weakness (exhaustion). An
    exhausted person may develop a &quot;passive&quot; outlook, thereby losing
    the will to survive.</p>
    <p>Seek natural shelters or alter them to meet your needs, therefore, saving
    energy. A common error in making a shelter is to make it too large. A
    shelter must be large enough to protect you and small enough to contain your
    body heat, especially in cold climates.</p>
  </blockquote>

<h3><a name="par1">PRIMARY SHELTER—UNIFORM</a></h3>
<p>5-1. Your primary shelter in a survival situation will be your uniform. This
point is true regardless of whether you are in a hot, cold, tropical, desert, or
arctic situation. For your uniform to protect you, it must be in as good of a
condition as possible and be worn properly. We use the term COLDER which is
addressed in <a href="survival://15.htm">Chapter
15</a> to remind us of what to do.</p>
<h3><a name="par2">SHELTER SITE SELECTION</a></h3>
<p>5-2. When you are in a survival situation and realize that shelter is a high
priority, start looking for shelter as soon as possible. As you do so, remember
what you will need at the site. Two requisites for shelter are that it must—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Contain material to make the type of shelter you need.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Be large enough and level enough for you to lie down comfortably.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>5-3. You should focus on your tactical situation and your safety when
considering these requisites. You must also consider whether the site—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Provides concealment from enemy observation.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Has camouflaged escape routes.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Is suitable for signaling, if necessary.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Provides protection against wild animals and rocks and dead trees that
    might fall.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Is free from insects, reptiles, and poisonous plants.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>5-4. You must remember the problems that could arise in your environment. For
instance, avoid—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Flash flood areas in foothills.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Avalanche or rockslide areas in mountainous terrain.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Sites near bodies of water that are below the high-water mark.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>5-5. In some areas, the season of the year has a strong bearing on the site
you select. Ideal sites for a shelter differ in winter and summer. During cold
winter months you will want a site that will protect you from the cold and wind,
but will have a source of fuel and water. During summer months in the same area
you will want a source of water, but you will also want the site to be almost
insect free.</p>
<p>5-6. When you are considering shelter site selection, remember the word BLISS
and the following guidelines:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>B-Blend in with the surroundings.</p>
  <li>
    <p>L-Low silhouette.</p>
  <li>
    <p>I-Irregular shape.</p>
  <li>
    <p>S-Small.</p>
  <li>
    <p>S-Secluded location.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="par3">TYPES OF SHELTERS</a></h3>
<p>5-7. When looking for a shelter site, keep in mind the type of shelter you
need. However, you must also consider the questions below:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>How much time and effort will you need to build the shelter?</p>
  <li>
    <p>Will the shelter adequately protect you from the elements (sun, wind,
    rain, snow)?</p>
  <li>
    <p>Do you have the tools to build it? If not, can you make improvised tools?</p>
  <li>
    <p>Do you have the type and amount of materials needed to build it?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>5-8. To answer these questions, you need to know how to make various types of
shelters and what materials you need to make them.</p>
<p><b>PONCHO LEAN-TO</b></p>
<p>5-9. It takes only a short time and minimal equipment to build this lean-to (<a href="#fig5-1">Figure
5-1</a>). You need a poncho, 2 to 3 meters (7 to 10 feet) of rope or parachute
suspension line, three stakes about 30 centimeters (1 foot) long, and two trees
or two poles 2 to 3 meters (7 to 10 feet) apart. Before selecting the trees you
will use or the location of your poles, check the wind direction. Ensure that
the back of your lean-to will be into the wind.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig5-1"></a><img height="163" alt="Figure 5-1. Poncho Lean-to" src="fig05-01.png" width="350"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 5-1. Poncho Lean-to</b></p>
<p>5-10. To make the lean-to, you should—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Tie off the hood of the poncho. Pull the drawstring tight, roll the hood
    longways, fold it into thirds, and tie it off with the drawstring.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Cut the rope in half. On one long side of the poncho, tie half of the
    rope to the corner grommet. Tie the other half to the other corner grommet.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Attach a drip stick (about a 10-centimeter [4-inch] stick) to each rope
    about 2.5 centimeters (about 1 inch) from the grommet. These drip sticks
    will keep rainwater from running down the ropes into the lean-to. Tying
    strings (about 10 centimeters [4 inches] long) to each grommet along the
    poncho's top edge will allow the water to run to and down the line without
    dripping into the shelter.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Tie the ropes about waist high on the trees. Use a round turn and two
    half hitches with a quick-release knot.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Spread the poncho and anchor it to the ground, putting sharpened sticks
    through the grommets and into the ground.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>5-11. If you plan to use the lean-to for more than one night, or you expect
rain, make a center support for the lean-to. Make this support with a line.
Attach one end of the line to the poncho hood and the other end to an
overhanging branch. Make sure there is no slack in the line.</p>
<p>5-12. Another method is to place a stick upright under the center of the
lean-to. However, this method will restrict your space and movements in the
shelter.</p>
<p>5-13. For additional protection from wind and rain, place some brush, your
rucksack, or other equipment at the sides of the lean-to.</p>
<p>5-14. To reduce heat loss to the ground, place some type of insulating
material, such as leaves or pine needles, inside your lean-to.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> When at rest, you lose as much as 80 percent of your body heat
to the ground.</p>
<p>5-15. To increase your security from enemy observation, lower the lean-to's
silhouette by making two changes. First, secure the support lines to the trees
at knee height (not at waist height) using two knee-high sticks in the two
center grommets (sides of lean-to). Second, angle the poncho to the ground,
securing it with sharpened sticks, as above.</p>
<p><b>PONCHO TENT</b></p>
<p>5-16. This tent (<a href="#fig5-2">Figure 5-2</a>) provides a low silhouette.
It also protects you from the elements on two sides. It has, however, less
usable space and observation area than a lean-to, decreasing your reaction time
to enemy detection. To make this tent, you need a poncho, two 1.5- to 2.5-meter
(5- to 8-foot) ropes, six sharpened sticks about 30 centimeters (1 foot) long,
and two trees 2 to 3 meters (7 to 10 feet) apart.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig5-2"></a><img height="167" alt="Figure 5-2. Poncho Tent Using Overhanging Branch" src="fig05-02.png" width="350"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 5-2. Poncho Tent Using Overhanging Branch</b></p>
<p>5-17. To make the tent, you should—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Tie off the poncho hood in the same way as the poncho lean-to.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Tie a 1.5- to 2.5-meter (5- to 8-foot) rope to the center grommet on each
    side of the poncho.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Tie the other ends of these ropes at about knee height to two trees 2 to
    3 meters (7 to 10 feet) apart and stretch the poncho tight.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Draw one side of the poncho tight and secure it to the ground pushing
    sharpened sticks through the grommets.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Follow the same procedure on the other side.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>5-18. If you need a center support, use the same methods as for the poncho
lean-to. Another center support is an A-frame set outside but over the center of
the tent (<a href="#fig5-3">Figure 5-3</a>). Use two 90- to 120-centimeter-long
(12- to 16-foot-long) sticks, one with a forked end, to form the A-frame. Tie
the hood's drawstring to the A-frame to support the center of the tent.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig5-3"></a><img height="197" alt="Figure 5-3. Poncho Tent With A-Frame" src="fig05-03.png" width="350"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 5-3. Poncho Tent With A-Frame</b></p>
<p><b>THREE-POLE PARACHUTE TEPEE</b></p>
<p>5-19. If you have a parachute and three poles and the tactical situation
allows, make a parachute tepee. It is easy and takes very little time to make
this tepee. It provides protection from the elements and can act as a signaling
device by enhancing a small amount of light from a fire or candle. It is large
enough to hold several people and their equipment and to allow sleeping,
cooking, and storing firewood.</p>
<p>5-20. You can make this tepee (<a href="#fig5-4">Figure 5-4</a>) using parts
of or a whole personnel main or reserve parachute canopy. If using a standard
personnel parachute, you need three poles 3.5 to 4.5 meters (12 to 15 feet) long
and about 5 centimeters (2 inches) in diameter.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig5-4"></a><img height="509" alt="Figure 5-4. Three-Pole Parachute Tepee" src="fig05-04.png" width="350"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 5-4. Three-Pole Parachute Tepee</b></p>
<p>5-21. To make this tepee, you should—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Lay the poles on the ground and lash them together at one end.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Stand the framework up and spread the poles to form a tripod.</p>
  <li>
    <p>For more support, place additional poles against the tripod. Five or six
    additional poles work best, but do not lash them to the tripod.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Determine the wind direction and locate the entrance 90 degrees or more
    from the mean wind direction.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Lay out the parachute on the &quot;backside&quot; of the tripod and
    locate the bridle loop (nylon web loop) at the top (apex) of the canopy.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Place the bridle loop over the top of a freestanding pole. Then place the
    pole back up against the tripod so that the canopy's apex is at the same
    height as the lashing on the three poles.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Wrap the canopy around one side of the tripod. The canopy should be of
    double thickness, as you are wrapping an entire parachute. You need only
    wrap half of the tripod, as the remainder of the canopy will encircle the
    tripod in the opposite direction.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Construct the entrance by wrapping the folded edges of the canopy around
    two free-standing poles. You can then place the poles side by side to close
    the tepee's entrance.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Place all extra canopy underneath the tepee poles and inside to create a
    floor for the shelter.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Leave a 30- to 50-centimeter (12- to 20-inch) opening at the top for
    ventilation if you intend to have a fire inside the tepee.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>5-22. You need a 14-gore section (normally) of canopy, stakes, a stout center
pole, and an inner core and needle to construct this tepee (<a href="#fig5-5">Figure
5-5</a>). You cut the suspension lines except for 40- to 45-centimeter (16- to
18-inch) lengths at the canopy's lower lateral band.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig5-5"></a><img height="182" alt="Figure 5-5. One-Pole Parachute Tepee" src="fig05-05.png" width="350"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 5-5. One-Pole Parachute Tepee</b></p>
<p>5-23. To make this tepee, you should—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Select a shelter site and scribe a circle about 4 meters (13 feet) in
    diameter on the ground.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Stake the parachute material to the ground using the lines remaining at
    the lower lateral band.</p>
  <li>
    <p>After deciding where to place the shelter door, emplace a stake and tie
    the first line (from the lower lateral band) securely to it.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Stretch the parachute material taut to the next line, emplace a stake on
    the scribed line, and tie the line to it.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Continue the staking process until you have tied all the lines.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Loosely attach the top of the parachute material to the center pole with
    a suspension line you previously cut and, through trial and error, determine
    the point at which the parachute material will be pulled tight once the
    center pole is upright.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Securely attach the material to the pole.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Using a suspension line (or inner core), sew the end gores together
    leaving 1 to 1.2 meters (3 to 4 feet) for a door.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>NO-POLE PARACHUTE TEPEE</b></p>
<p>5-24. Except for the center pole, you use the same materials for a no-pole
parachute tepee (<a href="#fig5-6">Figure 5-6</a>), as for the one-pole
parachute tepee.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig5-6"></a><img height="182" alt="Figure 5-6. No-Pole Parachute Tepee" src="fig05-06.png" width="350"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 5-6. No-Pole Parachute Tepee</b></p>
<p>5-25. To make this tepee, you should—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Tie a line to the top of parachute material with a previously cut
    suspension line.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Throw the line over a tree limb, and tie it to the tree trunk.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Starting at the opposite side from the door, emplace a stake on the
    scribed 3.5- to 4.3-meter (12- to 14-foot) circle.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Tie the first line on the lower lateral band.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Continue emplacing the stakes and tying the lines to them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>5-26. After staking down the material, unfasten the line tied to the tree
trunk, tighten the tepee material by pulling on this line, and tie it securely
to the tree trunk.</p>
<p><b>ONE-MAN SHELTER</b></p>
<p>5-27. A one-man shelter (<a href="#fig5-7">Figure 5-7</a>) you can easily
make using a parachute requires a tree and three poles. One pole should be about
4.5 meters (15 feet) long and the other two about 3 meters (10 feet) long.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig5-7"></a><img height="211" alt="Figure 5-7. One-Man Shelter" src="fig05-07.png" width="350"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 5-7. One-Man Shelter</b></p>
<p>5-28. To make this shelter, you should—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Secure the 4.5-meter (15-foot) pole to the tree at about waist height.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Lay the two 3-meter (10-foot) poles on the ground on either side of and
    in the same direction as the 4.5-meter (15-foot) pole.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Lay the folded canopy over the 4.5-meter (15-foot) pole so that about the
    same amount of material hangs on both sides.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Tuck the excess material under the 3-meter (10-foot) poles and spread it
    on the ground inside to serve as a floor.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Stake down or put a spreader between the two 3-meter (10-foot) poles at
    the shelter's entrance so they will not slide inward.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Use any excess material to cover the entrance.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>5-29. The parachute cloth makes this shelter wind-resistant, and the shelter
is small enough that it is easily warmed. A candle, used carefully, can keep the
inside temperature comfortable. However, this shelter is unsatisfactory when
snow is falling, as even a light snowfall will cave it in.</p>
<p><b>PARACHUTE HAMMOCK</b></p>
<p>5-30. You can make a hammock using six to eight gores of parachute canopy and
two trees about 4.5 meters (15 feet) apart (<a href="#fig5-8">Figure 5-8</a>).</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig5-8"></a><img height="509" alt="Figure 5-8. Parachute Hammock" src="fig05-08.png" width="350"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 5-8. Parachute Hammock</b></p>
<p><b>FIELD-EXPEDIENT LEAN-TO</b></p>
<p>5-31. If you are in a wooded area and have enough natural materials, you can
make a field-expedient lean-to (<a href="#fig5-9">Figure 5-9</a>) without the
aid of tools or with only a knife. It takes longer to make this type of shelter
than it does to make other types, but it will protect you from the elements.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig5-9"></a><img height="211" alt="Figure 5-9. Field-Expedient Lean-to and Fire Reflector" src="fig05-09.png" width="350"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 5-9. Field-Expedient Lean-to and Fire Reflector</b></p>
<p>5-32. You will need two trees (or upright poles) about 2 meters (7 feet)
apart; one pole about 2 meters (7 feet) long and 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) in
diameter; five to eight poles about 3 meters (10 feet) long and 2.5 centimeters
(1 inch) in diameter for beams; cord or vines for securing the horizontal
support to the trees; and other poles, saplings, or vines to crisscross the
beams.</p>
<p>5-33. To make this lean-to, you should—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Tie the 2-meter (7-foot) pole to the two trees at waist to chest height.
    This is the horizontal support. If a standing tree is not available,
    construct a bipod using Y-shaped sticks or two tripods.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Place one end of the beams (3-meter [10-foot] poles) on one side of the
    horizontal support. As with all lean-to type shelters, be sure to place the
    lean-to's backside into the wind.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Crisscross saplings or vines on the beams.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Cover the framework with brush, leaves, pine needles, or grass, starting
    at the bottom and working your way up like shingling.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Place straw, leaves, pine needles, or grass inside the shelter for
    bedding.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>5-34. In cold weather, add to your lean-to's comfort by building a fire
reflector wall (<a href="#fig5-9">Figure 5-9</a>). Drive four 1.5-meter-long
(5-foot-long) stakes into the ground to support the wall. Stack green logs on
top of one another between the support stakes. Form two rows of stacked logs to
create an inner space within the wall that you can fill with dirt. This action
not only strengthens the wall but makes it more heat reflective. Bind the top of
the support stakes so that the green logs and dirt will stay in place.</p>
<p>5-35. With just a little more effort you can have a drying rack. Cut a few
2-centimeter-diameter (3/4-inch-diameter) poles long enough to span the distance
between the lean-to's horizontal support and the top of the fire reflector wall.
Lay one end of the poles on the lean-to support and the other end on top of the
reflector wall. Place and tie smaller sticks across these poles. You now have a
place to dry clothes, meat, or fish.</p>
<p><b>SWAMP BED</b></p>
<p>5-36. In a marsh or swamp, or any area with standing water or continually wet
ground, the swamp bed (<a href="#fig5-10">Figure 5-10</a>) keeps you out of the
water. When selecting such a site, consider the weather, wind, tides, and
available materials.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig5-10"></a><img height="146" alt="Figure 5-10. Swamp Bed" src="fig05-10.png" width="350"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 5-10. Swamp Bed</b></p>
<p>5-37. To make a swamp bed, you should—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Look for four trees clustered in a rectangle, or cut four poles (bamboo
    is ideal) and drive them firmly into the ground so they form a rectangle.
    They should be far enough apart and strong enough to support your height and
    weight, to include equipment.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Cut two poles that span the width of the rectangle. They, too, must be
    strong enough to support your weight.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Secure these two poles to the trees (or poles). Be sure they are high
    enough above the ground or water to allow for tides and high water.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Cut additional poles that span the rectangle's length. Lay them across
    the two side poles and secure them.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Cover the top of the bed frame with broad leaves or grass to form a soft
    sleeping surface.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Build a fire pad by laying clay, silt, or mud on one corner of the swamp
    bed and allow it to dry.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>5-38. Another shelter designed to get you above and out of the water or wet
ground uses the same rectangular configuration as the swamp bed. You simply lay
sticks and branches lengthwise on the inside of the trees (or poles) until there
is enough material to raise the sleeping surface above the water level.</p>
<p><b>NATURAL SHELTERS</b></p>
<p>5-39. Do not overlook natural formations that provide shelter. Examples are
caves, rocky crevices, clumps of bushes, small depressions, large rocks on
leeward sides of hills, large trees with low-hanging limbs, and fallen trees
with thick branches. However, when selecting a natural formation—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Stay away from low ground such as ravines, narrow valleys, or creek beds.
    Low areas collect the heavy cold air at night and are therefore colder than
    the surrounding high ground. Thick, brushy, low ground also harbors more
    insects.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Check for poisonous snakes, ticks, mites, scorpions, and stinging ants.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Look for loose rocks, dead limbs, coconuts, or other natural growth than
    could fall on your shelter.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>DEBRIS HUT</b></p>
<p>5-40. For warmth and ease of construction, the debris hut (<a href="#fig5-11">Figure
5-11</a>) is one of the best. When shelter is essential to survival, build this
shelter.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig5-11"></a><img height="285" alt="Figure 5-11. Debris Hut" src="fig05-11.png" width="350"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 5-11. Debris Hut</b></p>
<p>5-41. To make a debris hut, you should—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Build it by making a tripod with two short stakes and a long ridgepole or
    by placing one end of a long ridgepole on top of a sturdy base.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Secure the ridgepole (pole running the length of the shelter) using the
    tripod method or by anchoring it to a tree at about waist height.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Prop large sticks along both sides of the ridgepole to create a
    wedge-shaped ribbing effect. Ensure the ribbing is wide enough to
    accommodate your body and steep enough to shed moisture.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Place finer sticks and brush crosswise on the ribbing. These form a
    latticework that will keep the insulating material (grass, pine needles,
    leaves) from falling through the ribbing into the sleeping area.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Add light, dry, if possible, soft debris over the ribbing until the
    insulating material is at least 1 meter (3 feet) thick—the thicker the
    better.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Place a 30-centimeter (1-foot) layer of insulating material inside the
    shelter.</p>
  <li>
    <p>At the entrance, pile insulating material that you can drag to you once
    inside the shelter to close the entrance or build a door.</p>
  <li>
    <p>As a final step in constructing this shelter, add shingling material or
    branches on top of the debris layer to prevent the insulating material from
    blowing away in a storm.</p>

<p><b>TREE-PIT SNOW SHELTER</b></p>
<p>5-42. If you are in a cold, snow-covered area where evergreen trees grow and
you have a digging tool, you can make a tree-pit shelter (<a href="#fig5-12">Figure
5-12</a>).</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 5-12. Tree-Pit Snow Shelter</b></p>
<p>5-43. To make this shelter, you should—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Find a tree with bushy branches that provides overhead cover.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Dig out the snow around the tree trunk until you reach the depth and
    diameter you desire, or until you reach the ground.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Pack the snow around the top and the inside of the hole to provide
    support.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Find and cut other evergreen boughs. Place them over the top of the pit
    to give you additional overhead cover. Place evergreen boughs in the bottom
    of the pit for insulation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>5-44. See <a href="survival://15.htm">Chapter
15</a> for other arctic or cold weather shelters.</p>
<p><b>BEACH SHADE SHELTER</b></p>
<p>5-45. The beach shade shelter (<a href="#fig5-13">Figure 5-13</a>) protects
you from the sun, wind, rain, and heat. It is easy to make using natural
materials.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig5-13"></a><img height="167" alt="Figure 5-13. Beach Shade Shelter" src="fig05-13.png" width="350"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 5-13. Beach Shade Shelter</b></p>
<p>5-46. To make this shelter, you should—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Find and collect driftwood or other natural material to use as support
    beams and as a digging tool.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Select a site that is above the high water mark.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Scrape or dig out a trench running north to south so that it receives the
    least amount of sunlight. Make the trench long and wide enough for you to
    lie down comfortably.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Mound soil on three sides of the trench. The higher the mound, the more
    space inside the shelter.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Lay support beams (driftwood or other natural material) that span the
    trench on top of the mound to form the framework for a roof.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Enlarge the shelter's entrance by digging out more sand in front of it.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Use natural materials such as grass or leaves to form a bed inside the
    shelter.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>DESERT SHELTERS</b></p>
<p>5-47. In an arid environment, consider the time, effort, and material needed
to make a shelter. If you have material such as a poncho, canvas, or a
parachute, use it along with such terrain features as rock outcroppings, mounds
of sand, or depressions between dunes or rocks to make your shelter.</p>
<p>5-48. When using rock outcroppings, you should—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Anchor one end of your poncho (canvas, parachute, or other material) on
    the edge of the outcrop using rocks or other weights.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Extend and anchor the other end of the poncho so it provides the best
    possible shade.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>5-49. In a sandy area, you should—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Build a mound of sand or use the side of a sand dune for one side of the
    shelter.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Anchor one end of the material on top of the mound using sand or other
    weights.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Extend and anchor the other end of the material so it provides the best
    possible shade.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> If you have enough material, fold it in half and form a 30- to
45-centimeter (12- to 18-inch) airspace between the two halves. This airspace
will reduce the temperature under the shelter.</p>
<p>5-50. A belowground shelter (<a href="#fig5-14">Figure 5-14</a>) can reduce
the midday heat as much as 16 to 22 degrees C (30 to 40 degrees F). However,
building it requires more time and effort than for other shelters. Since your
physical effort will make you sweat more and increase dehydration, construct it
before the heat of the day.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 5-14. Belowground Desert Shelter</b></p>
<p>5-51. To make this shelter, you should—</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Find a low spot or depression between dunes or rocks. If necessary, dig a
    trench 45 to 60 centimeters (18 to 24 inches) deep, and long and wide enough
    for you to lie in comfortably.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Pile the sand you take from the trench to form a mound around three
    sides.</p>
  <li>
    <p>On the open end of the trench, dig out more sand so you can get in and
    out of your shelter easily.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Cover the trench with your material.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Secure the material in place using sand, rocks, or other weights.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>5-52. If you have extra material, you can further decrease the midday
temperature in the trench by securing the material 30 to 45 centimeters (12 to
18 inches) above the other cover. This layering of the material will reduce the
inside temperature 11 to 22 degrees C (20 to 40 degrees F).</p>
<p>5-53. The open desert shelter is of similar construction, except all sides
are open to air currents and circulation. For maximum protection, you need a
minimum of two layers of parachute material (<a href="#fig5-15">Figure 5-15</a>).
White is the best color to reflect heat; the innermost layer should be of darker
material.</p>
