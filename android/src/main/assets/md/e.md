### WAYS TO AVOID SNAKEBITE

E-1\. Snakes are widely distributed. They are found in all tropical, subtropical, and most temperate regions. Some species of snakes have specialized glands that contain a toxic venom, and long, hollow fangs to inject their venom.

E-2\. Although venomous snakes use their venom to secure food, they also use it for self-defense. Human accidents occur when you don't see or hear the snake, when you step on them, or when you walk too close to them.

E-3\. Follow these simple rules to reduce the chance of accidental snakebite:

*   Don't sleep next to brush, tall grass, large boulders, or trees. They provide hiding places for snakes. Place your sleeping bag in a clearing. Use mosquito netting tucked well under the bag. This netting should provide a good barrier.

*   Don't put your hands into dark places, such as rock crevices, heavy brush, or hollow logs, without first investigating.

*   Don't step over a fallen tree. Step on the log and look to see if there is a snake resting on the other side.

*   Don't walk through heavy brush or tall grass without looking down. Look where you are walking.

*   Don't pick up any snake unless you are absolutely positive it is not venomous.

*   Don't pick up freshly killed snakes without first severing the head. The nervous system may still be active and a dead snake can deliver a bite.

### SNAKE GROUPS

E-4\. Snakes dangerous to man usually fall into two groups: proteroglypha and solenoglypha. Their fangs and their venom best describe these two groups ([Figure E-1](#fige-1)).

<a name="fige-1"></a>![Figure E-1\. Snake Group Characteristics](fige-1.png)

**Figure E-1\. Snake Group Characteristics**

**FANGS**

E-5\. The proteroglypha have, in front of the upper jaw and preceding the ordinary teeth, permanently erect fangs. These fangs are called fixed fangs.

E-6\. The solenoglypha have erectile fangs; that is, fangs they can raise to an erect position. These fangs are called folded fangs.

**VENOM**

E-7\. The fixed-fang snakes (proteroglypha) usually have neurotoxic venoms. These venoms affect the nervous system, making the victim unable to breathe.

E-8\. The folded-fang snakes (solenoglypha) usually have hemotoxic venoms. These venoms affect the circulatory system, destroying blood cells, damaging skin tissues, and causing internal hemorrhaging.

E-9\. Remember, however, that most venomous snakes have both neurotoxic and hemotoxic venom. Usually one type of venom in the snake is dominant and the other is weak.

**VENOMOUS VERSUS NONVENOMOUS SNAKES**

E-10\. No single characteristic distinguishes a venomous snake from a harmless one except the presence of poison fangs and glands. Only in dead specimens can you determine the presence of these fangs and glands without danger.

### DESCRIPTIONS OF VENOMOUS SNAKES

E-11\. There are many different venomous snakes throughout the world. It is unlikely you will see many except in a zoo. This manual describes only a few venomous snakes. However, you should be able to spot a venomous snake if you—

*   Learn about the two groups of snakes and the families in which they fall ([Figures E-2](#fige-2)).

*   Examine the pictures and read the descriptions of snakes in this appendix.

**Figure E-3\. Snake Families**

<a name="fige-3"></a>![Figure E-3\. Snake Families (Continued)](fige-3b.png)

**Figure E-3\. Snake Families (Continued)**

**VIPERIDAE**

E-12\. The viperidae, or true vipers, usually have thick bodies and heads that are much wider than their necks ([Figure E-4](#fige-4)). However, there are many different sizes, markings, and colorations.

<a name="fige-4"></a>![Figure E-4\. Positive Identification of Vipers](image271.jpg)

**Figure E-4\. Positive Identification of Vipers**

E-13\. This snake group has developed a highly sophisticated means for delivering venom. They have long, hollow fangs that perform like hypodermic needles. They deliver their venom deep into the wound.

E-14\. The fangs of this group of snakes are movable. These snakes fold their fangs into the roof of their mouths. When they strike, their fangs come forward, stabbing the victim. The snake controls the movement of its fangs; fang movement is not automatic. The venom is usually hemotoxic. However, there are several species that have large quantities of neurotoxic elements, thus making them even more dangerous. The vipers are responsible for many human fatalities around the world.

**CROTALIDAE**

E-15\. The crotalids, or pit vipers ([Figure E-5](#fige-5)), may be either slender or thick-bodied. Their heads are usually much wider than their necks. These snakes take their name from the deep pit located between the eye and the nostril. They are usually brown with dark blotches but some kinds are green.

<a name="fige-5"></a>![Figure E-5 Positive Identification of Pit Vipers](image272.jpg)

**Figure E-5 Positive Identification of Pit Vipers**

E-16\. Rattlesnakes, copperheads, cottonmouths, and several species of dangerous snakes from Central and South America, Asia, China, and India fall into the pit viper group. The pit is a highly sensitive organ capable of picking up the slightest temperature variance. Most pit vipers are nocturnal. They hunt for food at night with the aid of these specialized pits that let them locate prey in total darkness. Rattlesnakes are the only pit vipers that possess a rattle at the tip of the tail.

E-17\. India has about twelve species of these snakes. You find them in trees or on the ground in all types of terrain. The tree snakes are slender; the ground snakes are heavy-bodied. All are dangerous.

E-18\. China has a pit viper similar to the cottonmouth found in North America. You find it in the rocky areas of the remote mountains of South China. It reaches a length of 1.4 meters  
(5 feet) but is not vicious unless irritated. You can also find a small pit viper, about 45 centimeters (18 inches) long, on the plains of eastern China. It is too small to be dangerous to a man wearing shoes.

E-19\. There are about twenty-seven species of rattlesnakes in the United States and Mexico. They vary in color and may or may not have spots or blotches. Some are small but others, such as the diamondbacks, may grow to 2.5 meters (8 feet) long.

E-20\. There are five kinds of rattlesnakes in Central and South America, but only the tropical rattlesnake is widely distributed. The rattle on the tip of the tail is sufficient identification for a rattlesnake.

E-21\. Most will try to escape without a fight when approached, but there is always a chance one will strike at a passerby. They do not always give a warning; they may strike first and rattle afterwards or not at all.

E-22\. The genus _Trimeresurus_ is a subgroup of the crotalidae. These are Asian pit vipers. They are normally tree-loving snakes, but some live on the ground. They basically have the same characteristics of the crotalidae—slender build and very dangerous. Their bites usually are on the upper extremities—head, neck, and shoulders. Their venom is largely hemotoxic.

**ELAPIDAE**

E-23\. Elapidae are a group of highly dangerous snakes with a powerful neurotoxic venom that affects the nervous system, causing respiratory paralysis. Included in this family are coral snakes, cobras, mambas, and all the Australian venomous snakes. The coral snake is small and has caused human fatalities. The Australian death adder, tiger, taipan, and king brown snakes are among the most venomous in the world, causing many human fatalities.

E-24\. Only by examining a dead snake can you positively determine if it is a cobra or a near relative ([Figure E-6](#fige-6)). On cobras, kraits, and coral snakes, the third scale on the upper lip touches both the nostril scale and the eye. The krait also has a row of enlarged scales down its ridged back.

<a name="fige-6"></a>![Figure E-6\. Positive Identification of Cobras, Kraits,and Coral Snakes](image273.jpg)

**Figure E-6\. Positive Identification of Cobras, Kraits,and Coral Snakes**

E-25\. You can find the cobras of Africa and the Near East in almost any habitat. One kind may live in or near water, another in trees. Some are aggressive and savage. The distance a cobra can strike in a forward direction is equal to the distance its head is raised above the ground. Some cobras, however, can spit venom a distance of 3 to 3.5 meters (10 to 12 feet). This venom is harmless unless it gets into your eyes; then it may cause blindness if not washed out immediately. Poking around in holes and rock piles is dangerous because of the chance of encountering a spitting cobra.

**LATICAUDIDAE AND HYDROPHIDAE**

E-26\. A subfamily of elapidae, these snakes are specialized in that they found a better environment in the oceans. Why they are in the oceans is not clear to scientists.

E-27\. Sea snakes differ in appearance from other snakes in that they have an oarlike tail to aid in swimming. Some species of sea  
nakes have venom several times more toxic than the cobra's. Because of their marine environment, sea snakes seldom come in contact with humans. The exceptions are fisherman who capture these dangerous snakes in fishnets and scuba divers who swim in waters where sea snakes are found.

E-28\. There are many species of sea snakes. They vary greatly in color and shape. Their scales distinguish them from eels that have no scales.

E-29\. Sea snakes occur in salt water along the coasts throughout the Pacific. There are also sea snakes on the east coast of  
Africa and in the Persian Gulf. There are no sea snakes in the Atlantic Ocean.

E-30\. There is no need to fear sea snakes. They have not been known to attack a man swimming. Fishermen occasionally get bitten by a sea snake caught in a net. The bite is dangerous.

**COLUBRIDAE**

E-31\. The colubridae is the largest group of snakes worldwide. In this family there are species that are rear-fanged; however, most are completely harmless to man. They have a venom-producing gland and enlarged, grooved rear fangs that allow venom to flow into the wound. The inefficient venom apparatus and the specialized venom is effective on cold-blooded animals (such as frogs and lizards) but not considered a threat to human life. However, the boomslang and the twig snake of Africa have caused human deaths.

### LIZARDS

E-32\. There is little to fear from lizards as long as you follow the same precautions as for avoiding snakebite. There are only two poisonous lizards: the Gila monster and the Mexican beaded lizard. The venom of both these lizards is neurotoxic. The two lizards are in the same family, and both are slow moving with a docile nature.

E-33\. The komodo dragon _(Varanus komodoensis),_ although not poisonous, can be dangerous due to its large size. These lizards can reach lengths of 3 meters (10 feet) and weigh over 115 kilograms (253 pounds). Do not try to capture this lizard.

</center>

**American copperhead  
**_Agkistrodon contortrix_

**Description:** Chestnut color dominates overall, with darker crossbands of rich browns that become narrower on top and widen at the bottom. The top of the head is a coppery color.

**Characteristics:** Very common over much of its range, with a natural camouflage ability to blend in the environment. Copperheads are rather quiet and inoffensive in disposition but will defend themselves vigorously. Bites occur when the snakes are stepped on or when a victim is lying next to one. A copperhead lying on a bed of dead leaves becomes invisible. Its venom is hemotoxic.

**Habitat:** Found in wooded and rocky areas and mountainous regions.

**Length:** Average 60 centimeters (24 inches), maximum (47 inches) 120 centimeters.

**Distribution:** Texas, Oklahoma, Illinois, Kansas, Ohio, most of the southeast United States, and along the Atlantic coast from north Florida to Massachusetts ([Figure E-7](#fige-7)).

**Bushmaster  
**_Lachesis muta_

![](image276.jpg)

**Description:** The body hue is rather pale brown or pinkish, with a series of large bold dark brown or black blotches extending along the body. Its scales are extremely rough.

**Characteristics:** The world's largest pit viper has a bad reputation. This huge venomous snake is not common anywhere in its range. It lives in remote and isolated habitats and is largely nocturnal in its feeding habits. It seldom bites anyone, so few bites are recorded. A bite from one would indeed be very serious and fatal if medical aid was not immediately available. Usually, the bites occur in remote, dense jungles, many kilometers and several hours or even days away from medical help. Bushmaster fangs are long. In large bushmasters, they can measure 3.8 centimeters (1 3/4 inches). Its venom is a powerful hemotoxin.

**Habitat:** Found chiefly in tropical forests in their range.

**Length:** Average 2.1 meters (7 feet), maximum 3.7 meters (12 feet).

**Distribution:** Northern South America and parts of Central America, including Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Trinidad, and Brazil ([Figure E-8](#fige-8)).

**Coral snake  
**_Micrurus fulvius_

**Description:** Beautifully marked with bright blacks, reds, and yellows. To identify the species, remember that when red touches yellow it is a coral snake.

**Characteristics:** Common over range, but secretive in its habits, therefore seldom seen. It has short fangs that are fixed in an erect position. It often chews to release its venom into a wound. Its venom is very powerful. The venom is neurotoxic, causing respiratory paralysis in the victim, who succumbs to suffocation.

**Habitat:** Found in a variety of habitats including wooded areas, swamps, palmetto and scrub areas. Coral snakes often venture into residential locations.

**Length:** Average 60 centimeters (24 inches), maximum 115 centimeters (45 inches).

**Distribution:** Southeast United States and west to Texas. Another genus of coral snake is found in Arizona. Coral snakes are also found throughout Central and most of South America ([Figure E-9](#fige-9)).

**Cottonmouth**  
_Agkistrodon piscivorus_

**Description:** Colors are variable. Adults are uniformly olive brown or black. The young and subadults are strongly crossbanded with dark brown.

**Characteristics:** These dangerous semiaquatic snakes closely resemble harmless water snakes that have the same habitat. Therefore, it is best to leave all water snakes alone. Cottonmouths often stand their ground. An aroused cottonmouth will draw its head close to its body and open its mouth, showing its white interior. Cottonmouth venom is hemotoxic and potent. Bites are prone to gangrene.

**Habitat:** Found in swamps, lakes, rivers, and ditches.

**Length:** Average 90 centimeters (35 inches), maximum 1.8 meters (6 feet).

**Distribution:** Most of southeast United States, particularly southeast Virginia, west central Alabama, south Georgia, Illinois, east central Kentucky, south central Oklahoma, Texas, North and South Carolina, and Florida (including the Florida Keys) ([Figure E-10](#fige-10)).

**Eastern diamondback rattlesnake**  
_Crotalus adamanteus_

**Description:** Dark brown or black, outlined by a row of cream or yellowish scales. Ground color is olive to brown.

**Characteristics:** The largest venomous snake in the United States. Large snakes can have fangs that measure 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) in a straight line. This species has a sullen disposition, ready to defend itself when threatened. Its venom is potent and hemotoxic, causing great pain and damage to tissue.

**Habitat:** Found in palmettos and scrubs, swamps, pine woods, and flatwoods. It has been observed swimming many miles out in the Gulf of Mexico, reaching some of the islands off the Florida coast.

**Length:** Average 1.4 meters (5 feet), maximum 2.4 meters (8 feet).

**Distribution:** Coastal areas of North Carolina, South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida (including the Florida Keys) ([Figure E-11](#fige-11)).

**Eyelash pit viper  
**_Bothrops schlegeli_

**Description:** Identified by several spiny scales over each eye. Color is highly variable, from bright yellow over its entire body to reddish-yellow spots throughout the body.

**Characteristics:** Arboreal snake that seldom comes to the ground. It feels more secure in low-hanging trees where it looks for tree frogs and birds. It is a dangerous species because most of its bites occur on the upper extremities. It has an irritable disposition. It will strike with little provocation. Its venom is hemotoxic, causing severe tissue damage. Deaths have occurred from the bites of these snakes.

**Habitat:** Tree-loving species found in rain forests; common on plantations and in palm trees.

**Length:** Average 45 centimeters (18 inches), maximum 75 centimeters (30 inches).

**Distribution:** Southern Mexico, throughout Central America, Columbia, Ecuador, and Venezuela ([Figure E-12](#fige-12)).

**Fer-de-lance  
**_Bothrops atrox_  

There are several closely related species in this group. All are very dangerous to man.

**Description:** Variable coloration, from gray to olive, brown, or reddish, with dark triangles edged with light scales. Triangles are narrow at the top and wide at the bottom.

**Characteristics:** This highly dangerous snake is responsible for a high mortality rate. It has an irritable disposition, ready to strike with little provocation. The female fer-de-lance is highly prolific, producing up to 60 young, all with a dangerous bite. The venom of this species is hemotoxic, painful, and hemorrhagic (causing profuse internal bleeding). The venom causes massive tissue destruction.

**Habitat:** Found on cultivated land and farms, often entering houses in search of rodents.

**Length:** Average 1.4 meters (5 feet), maximum 2.4 meters (8 feet).

**Distribution:** Southern Mexico, throughout Central and South America ([Figure E-13](#fige-13)).

**Jumping viper**  
_Bothrops nummifer_  

**Description:** It has a stocky body. Its ground color varies from brown to gray and it has dark brown or black dorsal blotches. It has no pattern on its head.

**Characteristics:** It is chiefly a nocturnal snake. It comes out in the early evening hours to feed on lizards, rodents, and frogs. As the name implies, this species can strike with force as it actually leaves the ground. Its venom is hemotoxic. Humans have died from the bites inflicted by large jumping vipers. They often hide under fallen logs and piles of leaves and are difficult to see.

**Habitat:** Found in rain forests, on plantations, and on wooded hillsides.

**Length:** Average 60 centimeters (24 inches), maximum 120 centimeters (48 inches).

**Distribution:** Southern Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, and El Salvador ([Figure E-14](#fige-14)).

**Mojave rattlesnake**  
_Crotalus scutulatus_  

**Description:** This snake's entire body is a pallid or sandy color with darker diamond-shaped markings bordered by lighter-colored scales and black bands around the tail.

**Characteristics:** Although this rattlesnake is of moderate size, its bite is very serious. Its venom has quantities of neurotoxic elements that affect the central nervous system. Deaths have resulted from this snake's bite.

**Habitat:** Found in arid regions, deserts, and rocky hillsides from sea level to 2400-meter (7920-feet) elevations.

**Length:** Average 75 centimeters (29 inches), maximum 1.2 meters (4 feet).

**Distribution:** Southwest United States, particularly in the Mojave Desert in California, Nevada, southwest Arizona, and Texas into Mexico ([Figure E-15](#fige-15)).

**Western diamondback rattlesnake**  
_Crotalus atrox_  

**Description:** The body is a light buff color with darker brown diamond-shaped markings. The tail has heavy black and white bands.

**Characteristics:** This bold rattlesnake holds its ground. When coiled and rattling, it is ready to defend itself. It injects a large amount of venom when it bites, making it one of the most dangerous snakes. Its venom is hemotoxic, causing considerable pain and tissue damage.

**Habitat:** It is a very common snake over its range. It is found in grasslands, deserts, woodlands, and canyons.

**Length:** Average 1.5 meters (5 feet), maximum 2 meters (7 feet).

**Distribution:** Southwest United States, particularly southeast California, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona ([Figure E-17](#fige-17)).

**Long-nosed adder**  
_Vipera ammodytes_  

**Description:** Coloration is gray, brown, or reddish with a dark brown or black zigzag pattern running the length of its back. A dark stripe is usually found behind each eye.

**Characteristics:** A small snake commonly found in much of its range. The term "long-nosed" comes from the projection of tiny scales located on the tip of its nose. This viper is responsible for many bites. Deaths have been recorded. Its venom is hemotoxic, causing severe pain and massive tissue damage. The rate of survival is good with medical aid.

**Habitat:** Open fields, cultivated lands, farms, and rocky slopes.

**Length:** Average 45 centimeters (18 inches), maximum 90 centimeters (35 inches).

**Distribution:** Italy, Yugoslavia, northern Albania, and Romania ([Figure E-19](#fige-19)).

**Boomslang**  
_Dispholidus typus_  

**Description:** Coloration varies but is generally green or brown, which makes it very hard to see in its habitat.

**Characteristics:** Will strike if molested. Its venom is hemotoxic; even small amounts cause severe hemorrhaging, making it dangerous to man.

**Habitat:** Found in forested areas. It will spend most of its time in trees or looking for chameleons and other prey in bushes.

**Length:** Generally less than 60 centimeters (24 inches).

**Distribution:** Found throughout sub-Saharan Africa ([Figure E-22](#fige-22)).

**Bush viper**  
_Atheris squamiger_  

**Description:** Often called leaf viper, its color varies from ground colors of pale green to olive, brown, or rusty brown. The viper uses its prehensile tail to secure itself to branches.

**Characteristics:** An arboreal species that often comes down to the ground to feed on small rodents. It is not aggressive, but it will defend itself when molested or touched. Its venom is hemotoxic; healthy adults rarely die from its bite.

**Habitat:** Found in rain forests and woodlands bordering swamps and forests. Often found in trees, low-hanging branches, or brush.

**Length:** Average 45 centimeters (18 inches), maximum 75 centimeters (29 inches).

**Distribution:** Most of Africa, particularly Angola, Cameroon, Uganda, Kenya, and the Congo ([Figure E-23](#fige-23)).

**Common cobra** **or Asiatic cobra**  
_Naja naja_  

**Description:** Usually slate gray to brown overall. The back of the hood may or may not have a pattern.

**Characteristics:** A very common species responsible for many deaths each year. When aroused or threatened, the cobra will lift its head off the ground and spread its hood, making it more menacing. Its venom is highly neurotoxic, causing respiratory paralysis with some tissue damage. The cobra would rather retreat if possible, but if escape is shut off, it will be a dangerous creature to deal with.

**Habitat:** Found in any habitat: cultivated farms, swamps, open fields, and human dwellings, where it searches for rodents.
