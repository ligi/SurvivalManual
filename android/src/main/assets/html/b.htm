    <p>In a survival situation, plants can provide food and medicine. Their safe
    use requires absolutely positive identification, knowing how to prepare them
    for eating, and knowing any dangerous properties they might have.
    Familiarity with botanical structures of plants and information on where
    they grow will make them easier to locate and identify. This appendix
    provides pictures, descriptions, habitats and distribution, and edible parts
    of the most common plants that you might encounter.</p>

        <p><b>Abal</b><br>
        <i>Calligonum comosum</i><br>
        <p><b>Description:</b> The abal is one of the few shrubby plants that
        exist in the shady deserts. This plant grows to about 1.2 meters (4
        feet), and its branches look like wisps from a broom. The stiff, green
        branches produce an abundance of flowers in March and April.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> This plant is found in desert scrub
        and waste in any climatic zone. It inhabits much of the North African
        desert. It may also be found on the desert sands of the Middle East and
        as far eastward as the Rajputana desert of western India.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> This plant's general appearance would not
        indicate its usefulness to you, but while this plant is flowering in the
        spring, its fresh flowers can be eaten. It is common in the areas where
        it is found. An analysis of the abal's food value has shown it to be
        high in sugar and nitrogenous components.</p>

        <p><b>Almond</b><br>
        <i>Prunus amygdalus</i><br>
        <p><b>Description:</b> The almond tree, which sometimes grows to 12.2
        meters (40 feet), looks like a peach tree. The fresh almond fruit
        resembles a gnarled, unripe peach and grows in clusters. The stone (the
        almond itself) is covered with a thick, dry, woolly skin.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> Almonds are found in the scrub and
        thorn forests of the tropics, the evergreen scrub forests of temperate
        areas, and in desert scrub and waste in all climatic zones. The almond
        tree is also found in the semidesert areas of the Old World in southern
        Europe, the eastern Mediterranean, Iran, the Middle East, China,
        Madeira, the Azores, and the Canary Islands.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> The mature almond fruit splits open lengthwise
        down the side, exposing the ripe almond nut. You can easily get the dry
        kernel by simply cracking open the stone. Almond meats are rich in food
        value, like all nuts. Gather them in large quantities and shell them for
        further use as survival food. You could live solely on almonds for
        rather long periods. When you boil them, the kernel's outer covering
        comes off and only the white meat remains.</p>

        <p><b>Description:</b> These plants, which grow 90 to 150 centimeters
        (35 to 60 inches) tall, are abundant weeds in many parts of the world.
        All amaranth have alternate simple leaves. They may have some red color
        present on the stems. They bear minute, greenish flowers in dense
        clusters at the top of the plants. Their seeds may be brown or black in
        weedy species and light-colored in domestic species.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> Look for amaranth along roadsides,
        in disturbed waste areas, or as weeds in crops throughout the world.
        Some amaranth species have been grown as a grain crop and a garden
        vegetable in various parts of the world, especially in South America.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> All parts are edible, but some may have sharp
        spines you should remove before eating. The young plants or the growing
        tips of older plants are an excellent vegetable. Simply boil the young
        plants or eat them raw. Their seeds are very nutritious. Shake the tops
        of older plants to get the seeds. Eat the seeds raw, boiled, ground into
        flour, or popped like popcorn.</p>

        <p><b>Description:</b> Bamboos are woody grasses that grow up to 15
        meters (50 feet) tall. The leaves are grasslike and the stems are the
        familiar bamboos used in furniture and fishing poles.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> Look for bamboo in warm, moist
        regions in open or jungle country, in lowland, or on mountains. Bamboos
        are native to the Far East (temperate and tropical zones) but have been
        widely planted around the world.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> The young shoots of almost all species are
        edible raw or cooked. Raw shoots have a slightly bitter taste that is
        removed by boiling. To prepare, remove the tough protective sheath that
        is coated with tawny or red hairs. The seed grain of the flowering
        bamboo is also edible. Boil the seeds like rice or pulverize them, mix
        with water, and make into cakes.</p>

        branches. Its fruit is shaped like a football, measures up to 45
        centimeters (18 inches) long, and is covered with short dense hair.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> These trees grow in savannas. They
        are found in Africa, in parts of Australia, and on the island of
        Madagascar.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts: </b>You can use the young leaves as a soup
        vegetable. The tender root of the young baobab tree is edible. The pulp
        and seeds of the fruit are also edible. Use one handful of pulp to about
        one cup of water for a refreshing drink. To obtain flour, roast the
        seeds, and then grind them.</p>
        <p><b>Other Uses:</b> Drinking a mixture of pulp and water will help
        cure diarrhea. Often the hollow trunks are good sources of fresh water.

        Beech relatives are also found in Chile, New Guinea, and New Zealand.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> The mature beechnuts readily fall out of the
        husklike seedpods. You can eat these dark-brown, triangular nuts by
        breaking the thin shell with your fingernail and removing the white,
        sweet kernel inside. Beechnuts are one of the most delicious of all wild
        nuts. They are a most useful survival food because of the kernel's high
        oil content. You can also use the beechnuts as a coffee substitute.
        Roast them so that the kernel becomes golden brown and quite hard. Then
        pulverize the kernel and, after boiling or steeping in hot water, you
        have a passable coffee substitute.</p>

        <p><b>Description:</b> The canna lily is a coarse perennial herb, 90
        centimeters (36 inches) to 3 meters (10 feet) tall. The plant grows from
        a large, thick, underground rootstock that is edible. Its large leaves
        resemble those of the banana plant but are not so large. The flowers of
        wild canna lily are usually small, relatively inconspicuous, and
        brightly colored reds, oranges, or yellows.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> As a wild plant, the canna lily is
        found in all tropical areas, especially in moist places along streams,
        springs, ditches, and the margins of woods. It may also be found in wet
        temperate, mountainous regions. It is easy to recognize because it is
        commonly cultivated in flower gardens in the United States.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> The large and much-branched rootstocks are full
        of edible starch. The younger parts may be finely chopped and then

        <i>Anacardium occidentale</i><br>
        <p><b>Description:</b> The cashew is a spreading evergreen tree growing
        to a height of 12 meters (40 feet), with leaves up to 20 centimeters (8
        inches) long and 10 centimeters (4 inches) wide. Its flowers are
        yellowish-pink. Its fruit is very easy to recognize because of its
        peculiar structure. The fruit is thick and pear-shaped, pulpy and red or
        yellow when ripe. This fruit bears a hard, green, kidney-shaped nut at
        its tip. This nut is smooth, shiny, and green or brown according to its
        maturity.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> The cashew is native to the West
        Indies and northern South America, but transplantation has spread it to
        all tropical climates. In the Old World, it has escaped from cultivation
        and appears to be wild at least in parts of Africa and India.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> The nut encloses one seed. The seed is edible

        leaves 1 to 5 centimeters (1/4 to 2 inches) wide and growing up to 1.8
        meters (6 feet) tall. The male flowers are borne in a dense mass above
        the female flowers. The male flowers last only a short time, leaving the
        female flowers, which develop into the brown cattail. Pollen from the
        male flowers is often abundant and bright yellow.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> Cattails are found throughout most
        of the world. Look for them in full sun areas at the margins of lakes,
        streams, canals, rivers, and brackish water.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> The young tender shoots are edible raw or
        cooked. The rhizome is often very tough but is a rich source of starch.
        Pound the rhizome to remove the starch and use as a flour. The pollen is
        also an exceptional source of starch. When the cattail is immature and
        still green, you can boil the female portion and eat it like corn on the
        cob.</p>
        <p><b>Other Uses:</b> The dried leaves are an excellent source of
        weaving material you can use to make floats and rafts. The cottony seeds
        make good pillow stuffing and insulation. The fluff makes excellent
        tinder. Dried cattails are effective insect repellents when burned.</p>

        to 18 meters (60 feet) in height.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> In temperate regions, the chestnut
        is found in both hardwood and coniferous forests. In the tropics, it is
        found in semievergreen seasonal forests. They are found over all of
        middle and south Europe and across middle Asia to China and Japan. They
        are relatively abundant along the edge of meadows and as a forest tree.
        The European chestnut is one of the most common varieties. Wild
        chestnuts in Asia belong to the related chestnut species.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> Chestnuts are highly useful as survival food.
        Ripe nuts are usually picked in autumn, although unripe nuts picked
        while green may also be used for food. Perhaps the easiest way to
        prepare them is to roast the ripe nuts in embers. Cooked this way, they
        are quite tasty, and you can eat large quantities. Another way is to
        boil the kernels after removing the outer shell. After boiling the nuts
        until fairly soft, you can mash them like potatoes.</p>

        <p><b>Edible Parts: </b>The nut is a valuable source of food. The milk
        of the young coconut is rich in sugar and vitamins and is an excellent
        source of liquid. The nut meat is also nutritious but is rich in oil. To
        preserve the meat, spread it in the sun until it is completely dry.</p>
        <p><b>Other Uses:</b> Use coconut oil to cook and to protect metal
        objects from corrosion. Also, use the oil to treat saltwater sores,
        sunburn, and dry skin. Use the oil in improvised torches. Use the tree
        trunk as building material and the leaves as thatch. Hollow out the
        large stump for use as a food container. The coconut husks are good
        flotation devices and the husk's fibers are used to weave ropes and
        other items. Use the gauzelike fibers at the leaf bases as strainers or
        use them to weave a bug net or to make a pad to use on wounds. The husk
        makes a good abrasive. Dried husk fiber is an excellent tinder. A
        smoldering husk helps to repel mosquitoes. Smoke caused by dripping
        coconut oil in a fire also repels mosquitoes. To render coconut oil, put
        the coconut meat in the sun, heat it over a slow fire, or boil it in a
        pot of water. Coconuts washed out to sea are a good source of fresh
        liquid for the sea survivor.</p>

        <p><b>Common jujube</b><br>
        <i>Ziziphus jujuba</i><br>
        <p><b>Description:</b> The common jujube is either a deciduous tree
        growing to a height of 12 meters (40 feet) or a large shrub, depending
        upon where it grows and how much water is available for growth. Its
        branches are usually spiny. Its reddish-brown to yellowish-green fruit
        is oblong to ovoid, 3 centimeters (1 inch) or less in diameter, smooth,
        and sweet in flavor, but with a rather dry pulp around a comparatively
        large stone. Its flowers are green.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> The jujube is found in forested
        areas of temperate regions and in desert scrub and waste areas
        worldwide. It is common in many of the tropical and subtropical areas of
        the Old World. In Africa, it is found mainly bordering the
        Mediterranean. In Asia, it is especially common in the drier parts of
        India and China. The jujube is also found throughout the East Indies. It
        can be found bordering some desert areas.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts: </b>The pulp, crushed in water, makes a refreshing
        beverage. If time permits, you can dry the ripe fruit in the sun like
        dates. Its fruit is high in vitamins A and C.</p>

        <i>Caryota urens</i><br>
        <p><b>Description:</b> Fishtail palms are large trees, at least 18
        meters (60 feet) tall. Their leaves are unlike those of any other palm;
        the leaflets are irregular and toothed on the upper margins. All other
        palms have either fan-shaped or featherlike leaves. Its massive
        flowering shoot is borne at the top of the tree and hangs downward.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> The fishtail palm is native to the
        tropics of India, Assam, and Myanmar. Several related species also exist
        in Southeast Asia and the Philippines. These palms are found in open
        hill country and jungle areas.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> The chief food in this palm is the starch stored
        in large quantities in its trunk. The juice from the fishtail palm is
        very nourishing and you have to drink it shortly after getting it from
        the palm flower shoot. Boil the juice down to get a rich sugar syrup.
        Use the same method as for the sugar palm to get the juice. The palm
        cabbage may be eaten raw or cooked.</p>

        <i>Psophocarpus tetragonolobus</i><br>
        <p><b>Description:</b> The goa bean is a climbing plant that may cover
        small shrubs and trees. Its bean pods are 22 centimeters (9 inches)
        long, its leaves 15 centimeters (6 inches) long, and its flowers are
        bright blue. The mature pods are 4-angled, with jagged wings on the
        pods.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> This plant grows in tropical Africa,
        Asia, the East Indies, the Philippines, and Taiwan. This member of the
        bean (legume) family serves to illustrate a kind of edible bean common
        in the tropics of the Old World. Wild edible beans of this sort are most
        frequently found in clearings and around abandoned garden sites. They
        are more rare in forested areas.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> You can eat the young pods like string beans.
        The mature seeds are a valuable source of protein after parching or
        roasting them over hot coals. You can germinate the seeds (as you can
        many kinds of beans) in damp moss and eat the resultant sprouts. The
        thickened roots are edible raw. They are slightly sweet, with the

        <p><b>Hazelnut or wild filbert</b><br>
        <i>Corylus</i> species<br>
        <p><b>Description:</b> Hazelnuts grow on bushes 1.8 to 3.6 meters (6 to
        12 feet) high. One species in Turkey and another in China are large
        trees. The nut itself grows in a very bristly husk that conspicuously
        contracts above the nut into a long neck. The different species vary in
        this respect as to size and shape.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution: </b>Hazelnuts are found over wide areas
        in the United States, especially the eastern half of the country and
        along the Pacific coast. These nuts are also found in Europe where they
        are known as filberts. The hazelnut is common in Asia, especially in
        eastern Asia from the Himalayas to China and Japan. The hazelnut usually
        grows in the dense thickets along stream banks and open places. They are
        not plants of the dense forest.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> Hazelnuts ripen in the autumn, when you can
        crack them open and eat the kernel. The dried nut is extremely
        delicious. The nut's high oil content makes it a good survival food.
        When they are unripe, you can crack them open and eat the fresh kernel.</p>

        pendulous fruits grow on the ends of the branches. Its fruit (pod) looks
        like a giant bean. Its 25- to 60-centimeter-long pods are triangular in
        cross section, with strong ribs. Its roots have a pungent odor.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> This tree is found in the rain
        forests and semievergreen seasonal forests of the tropical regions. It
        is widespread in India, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Central America.
        Look for it in abandoned fields and gardens and at the edges of forests.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> The leaves are edible raw or cooked, depending
        on their hardness. Cut the young seedpods into short lengths and cook
        them like string beans or fry them. You can get oil for frying by
        boiling the young fruits of palms and skimming the oil off the surface
        of the water. You can eat the flowers as part of a salad. You can chew
        fresh, young seedpods to eat the pulpy and soft seeds. The roots may be
        ground as a substitute for seasoning similar to horseradish.</p>

        meters (3 to 9 feet) tall, with jointed stems and deep green, fingerlike
        leaves. It has large, fleshy rootstocks.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> Manioc is widespread in all tropical
        climates, particularly in moist areas. Although cultivated extensively,
        it may be found in abandoned gardens and growing wild in many areas.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> The rootstocks are full of starch and high in
        food value. Two kinds of manioc are known: bitter and sweet. Both are
        edible. The bitter type contains poisonous hydrocyanic acid. To prepare
        manioc, first grind the fresh manioc root into a pulp, then cook it for
        at least 1 hour to remove the bitter poison from the roots. Then flatten
        the pulp into cakes and bake as bread. Manioc cakes or flour will keep
        almost indefinitely if protected against insects and dampness. Wrap
        manioc in banana leaves for protection.</p>

        There are two main groups of oaks: red and white. The red oak group has
        leaves with bristles and smooth bark in the upper part of the tree. Red
        oak acorns take 2 years to mature. The white oak group has leaves
        without bristles and a rough bark in the upper portion of the tree.
        White oak acorns mature in 1 year.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> Oak trees are found in many habitats
        throughout North America, Central America, and parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> All parts are edible, but often contain large
        quantities of bitter substances. White oak acorns usually have a better
        flavor than red oak acorns. Gather and shell the acorns. Soak red oak
        acorns in water for 1 to 2 days to remove the bitter substance. You can
        speed up this process by putting wood ashes in the water in which you
        soak the acorns. Boil the acorns or grind them into flour and use the
        flour for baking. You can use acorns that you baked until very dark as a
        coffee substitute.</p>

        <p><b>Papaya or pawpaw</b><br>
        <i>Carica papaya</i><br>
        <p><b>Description:</b> The papaya is a small tree 1.8 to 6 meters (6 to
        20 feet) tall, with a soft, hollow trunk. When cut, the entire plant
        exudes a milky juice. The trunk is rough and the leaves are crowded at
        the trunk's apex. The fruit grows directly from the trunk, among and
        below the leaves. The fruit is green before ripening. When ripe, it
        turns yellow or remains greenish with a squashlike appearance.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> Papaya is found in rain forests and
        semievergreen seasonal forests in tropical regions and in some temperate
        regions as well. Look for it in moist areas near clearings and former
        habitations. It is also found in open, sunny places in uninhabited
        jungle areas.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> The ripe fruit is high in vitamin C. Eat it raw
        or cook it like squash. Place green fruit in the sun to make it ripen
        quickly. Cook the young papaya leaves, flowers, and stems carefully,
        changing the water as for taro.</p>
        <p><b>Other Uses:</b> Use the milky juice of the unripe fruit to
        tenderize tough meat. Rub the juice on the meat.</p>

        <i>Pinus</i> species<br>
        <p align="left"><b>Description:</b> Pine trees are easily recognized by
        their needlelike leaves grouped in bundles. Each bundle may contain one
        to five needles, the number varying among species. The tree's odor and
        sticky sap provide a simple way to distinguish pines from similar
        looking trees with needlelike leaves.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> Pines prefer open,
        sunny areas. They are found throughout North America, Central America,
        much of the Caribbean region, North Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and
        some places in Asia.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Edible Parts:</b> The seeds of all species are
        edible. You can collect the young male cones, which grow only in the
        spring, as a survival food. Boil or bake the young cones. The bark of
        young twigs is edible. Peel off the bark of thin twigs. You can chew the
        juicy inner bark; it is rich in sugar and vitamins. Eat the seeds raw or
        cooked. Green pine needle tea is high in vitamin C.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Other Uses:</b> Use the resin to waterproof articles.
        Also, use it as glue. Collect the resin from the tree. If there is not
        enough resin on the tree, cut a notch in the bark so more sap will seep
        out. Put the resin in a container and heat it. The hot resin is your
        glue. Use it as is or add a small amount of ash dust to strengthen it.
        Use it immediately. You can use hardened pine resin as an emergency
        dental filling.</p>

        <p><b>Description:</b> The broad leaf plantain has leaves over 2.5
        centimeters (1 inch) across that grow close to the ground. The flowers
        are on a spike that rises from the middle of the cluster of leaves. The
        narrow leaf plantain has leaves up to 12 centimeters (5 inches) long and
        2.5 centimeters (1 inch) wide, covered with hairs. The leaves form a
        rosette. The flowers are small and inconspicuous.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> Look for these plants in lawns and
        along roads in the north temperate zone. This plant is a common weed
        throughout much of the world.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> The young tender leaves are edible raw. Older
        leaves should be cooked. Seeds are edible raw or roasted.</p>
        <p><b>Other Uses:</b> To relieve pain from wounds and sores, wash and
        soak the entire plant for a short time and apply it to the injured area.
        To treat diarrhea, drink tea made from 28 grams (1 ounce) of the plant
        leaves boiled in 0.5 liter of water. The seeds and seed husks act as

        attached to the trees on which it grows. Sometimes, mature stems grow to
        90 meters (300 feet). It has alternate, compound leaves and a whitish
        flower.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> The rattan palm is

        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> These palms, when available, are of great use to
        the survivor. One trunk, cut just before it flowers, will yield enough
        sago to feed a person for 1 year. Obtain sago starch from nonflowering
        palms. To extract the edible sage, cut away the bark lengthwise from one
        half of the trunk and pound the soft, whitish inner part (pith) as fine
        as possible. Knead the pith in water and strain it through a coarse
        cloth into a container. The fine, white sago will settle in the
        container. Once the sago settles, it is ready for use. Squeeze off the
        excess water and let it dry. Cook it as pancakes or oatmeal. Two
        kilograms of sago is the nutritional equivalent of 1.5 kilograms of
        rice. The upper part of the trunk's core does not yield sago, but you
        can roast it in lumps over a fire. You can also eat the young sago nuts
        and the growing shoots or palm cabbage.</p>

        <p><b>Description:</b> The screw pine is a strange plant on stilts, or
        prop roots, that support the plant above ground so that it appears
        suspended in midair. These plants are either shrubby or treelike, 3 to 9
        meters (9 to 27 feet) tall, with stiff leaves having sawlike edges. The
        fruits are large, roughened balls resembling pineapples but without the
        tuft of leaves at the end.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> The screw pine is a tropical plant
        that grows in rain forests and semievergreen seasonal forests. It is
        found mainly along seashores, although certain kinds occur inland for
        some distance, from Madagascar to southern Asia and the islands of the
        southwestern Pacific. There are about 180 types.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> Knock the ripe fruit to the ground to separate
        the fruit segments from the hard outer covering. Chew the inner fleshy
        part. Cook in an earth oven fruit that is not fully ripe. Before
        cooking, wrap the whole fruit in banana leaves, breadfruit leaves, or
        any other suitable thick, leathery leaves. After cooking for about 2
        hours, you can chew fruit segments like ripe fruit. Green fruit is
        inedible.</p>

        West Indies, Central America, and tropical South America.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> The pulp surrounding the seeds is rich in
        vitamin C and is an important survival food. You can make a pleasantly
        acid drink by mixing the pulp with water and sugar or honey and letting
        the mixture mature for several days. Suck the pulp to relieve thirst.
        Cook the young, unripe fruits or seedpods with meat. Use the young
        leaves in soup. You must cook the seeds. Roast them above a fire or in
        ashes. Another way is to remove the seed coat and soak the seeds in
        salted water and grated coconut for 24 hours, then cook them. You can
        peel the tamarind bark and chew it.</p>

        <p><b>Description:</b> The ti has unbranched stems with straplike leaves
        often clustered at the tip of the stem. The leaves vary in color and may
        be green or reddish. The flowers grow at the plant's top in large,
        plumelike clusters. The ti may grow up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) tall.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> Look for this plant at the margins
        of forests or near homesites in tropical areas. It is native to the Far
        East but is now widely planted in tropical areas worldwide.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> The roots and very tender young leaves are good
        survival foods. Boil or bake the short, stout roots found at the base of
        the plant. They are a valuable source of starch. Boil the very young
        leaves to eat. You can use the leaves to wrap other food to cook over
        coals or to steam.</p>
        <p><b>Other Uses:</b> Use the leaves to cover shelters or to make a rain
        cloak. Cut the leaves into liners for shoes; this works especially well
        if you have a blister. Fashion temporary sandals from the leaves. The
        terminal leaf, if not completely unfurled, can be used as a sterile
        bandage. Cut the leaves into strips, then braid the strips into rope.</p>

        <p><b>Description:</b> Walnuts grow on very large trees, often reaching
        18 meters (54 feet) tall. The divided leaves characterize all walnut
        spades. The walnut itself has a thick outer husk that must be removed to
        reach the hard inner shell of the nut.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> The English walnut, in the wild
        state, is found from southeastern Europe across Asia to China and is
        abundant in the Himalayas. Several other species of walnut are found in
        China and Japan. The black walnut is common in the eastern United
        States.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> The nut kernel ripens in the autumn. You get the
        walnut meat by cracking the shell. Walnut meats are highly nutritious
        because of their protein and oil content.</p>
        <p><b>Other Uses:</b> You can boil walnuts and use the juice as an
        antifungal agent. The husks of &quot;green&quot; walnuts produce a dark
        brown dye for clothing or camouflage. Crush the husks of
        &quot;green&quot; black walnuts and sprinkle them into sluggish water or
        ponds for use as fish poison.</p>

        <p><b>Water lettuce</b><br>
        <i>Ceratopteris</i> species<br>
        <p><b>Description:</b> The leaves of water lettuce are much like lettuce
        and are very tender and succulent. One of the easiest ways of
        distinguishing water lettuce is by the little plantlets that grow from
        the margins of the leaves. These little plantlets grow in the shape of a
        rosette. Water lettuce plants often cover large areas in the regions
        where they are found.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> Found in the tropics throughout the
        Old World in both Africa and Asia. Another kind is found in the New
        World tropics from Florida to South America. Water lettuce grows only in
        very wet places and often as a floating water plant. Look for water
        lettuce in still lakes, ponds, and the backwaters of rivers.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> Eat the fresh leaves like lettuce. Be careful
        not to dip the leaves in the contaminated water in which they are
        growing. Eat only the leaves that are well out of the water.</p>

        <i>Malus</i> species<br>
        <p><b>Description:</b> Most wild apples look enough like domestic apples
        that the survivor can easily recognize them. Wild apple varieties are
        much smaller than cultivated kinds; the largest kinds usually do not
        exceed 5 to 7.5 centimeters (2 to 3 inches) in diameter, and most often
        are smaller. They have small, alternate, simple leaves and often have
        thorns. Their flowers are white or pink and their fruits reddish or
        yellowish.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> They are found in the savanna
        regions of the tropics. In temperate areas, wild apple varieties are
        found mainly in forested areas. Most frequently, they are found on the
        edge of woods or in fields. They are found throughout the Northern
        Hemisphere.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> Prepare wild apples for eating in the same

        <i>Rumex crispus</i> and <i>Rumex acetosella</i><br>
        <p><b>Description:</b> Wild dock is a stout plant with most of its
        leaves at the base of its stem that is commonly 15 to 30 centimeters (6
        to 12 inches) long. The plants usually develop from a strong, fleshy,
        carrotlike taproot. Its flowers are usually very small, growing in green
        to purplish plumelike clusters. Wild sorrel is similar to wild dock but
        smaller. Many of the basal leaves are arrow-shaped. They are smaller
        than those of dock and contain sour juice.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> These plants can be found in almost
        all climatic zones of the world. They can grow in areas of high or low
        rainfall. Many kinds are found as weeds in fields, along roadsides, and
        in waste places.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> Because of the tender nature of their foliage,
        sorrel and dock are useful plants, especially in desert areas. You can
        eat their succulent leaves fresh or slightly cooked. To take away the
        strong taste, change the water once or twice during cookinga useful

        <i>Luffa cylindrica</i><br>
        <p><b>Description:</b> The luffa sponge is widely distributed and fairly
        typical of a wild squash. There are several dozen kinds of wild squashes
        in tropical regions. Like most squashes, the luffa is a vine with leaves
        7.5 to 20 centimeters (3 to 8 inches) across having 3 lobes. Some
        squashes have leaves twice this size. Luffa fruits are oblong or
        cylindrical, smooth, and many-seeded. Luffa flowers are bright yellow.
        The luffa fruit, when mature, is brown and resembles the cucumber.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> A member of the squash family, which
        also includes the watermelon, cantaloupe, and cucumber, the luffa sponge
        is widely cultivated throughout the tropical zone. It may be found in a
        semiwild state in old clearings and abandoned gardens in rain forests
        and semievergreen seasonal forests.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts: </b>You can boil the young green (half-ripe) fruit
        and eat them as a vegetable. Adding coconut milk will improve the
        flavor. After ripening, the luffa sponge develops an inedible spongelike
        texture in the interior of the fruit. You can also eat the tender
        shoots, flowers, and young leaves after cooking them. Roast the mature
        seeds a little and eat them like peanuts.</p>

        tendrils. Most grapevines produce deeply lobed leaves similar to the
        cultivated grape. Wild grapes grow in pyramidal, hanging bunches and are
        black-blue to amber, or white when ripe.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> Wild grapes are distributed
        worldwide. Some kinds are found in deserts, others in temperate forests,
        and others in tropical areas. Wild grapes are commonly found throughout
        the eastern United States as well as in the southwestern desert areas.
        Most kinds are rampant climbers over other vegetation. The best place to
        look for wild grapes is on the edges of forested areas. Wild grapes are
        also found in Mexico. In the Old World, wild grapes are found from the
        Mediterranean region eastward through Asia, the East Indies, and to
        Australia. Africa also has several kinds of wild grapes.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> The ripe grape is the portion eaten. Grapes are
        rich in natural sugars and, for this reason, are much sought after as a
        source of energy-giving wild food. None are poisonous.</p>
        <p><b>Other Uses:</b> You can obtain water from severed grapevine stems.
        Cut off the vine at the bottom and place the cut end in a container.
        Make a slant-wise cut into the vine about 1.8 meters (6 feet) up on the
        hanging part. This cut will allow water to flow from the bottom end. As
        water diminishes in volume, make additional cuts farther down the vine.</p>

        <i>Zizania aquatica</i><br>
        <p><b>Description:</b> Wild rice is a tall grass that typically is 1 to
        1.5 meters (3 to 4 feet) in height, but may reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
        Its grain grows in very loose heads at the top of the plant and is dark
        brown or blackish when ripe.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> Wild rice grows only in very wet
        areas in tropical and temperate regions.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> During the spring and summer, the central
        portion of the lower stems and root shoots are edible. Remove the tough
        covering before eating. During the late summer and fall, collect the
        straw-covered husks. Dry and parch the husks, break them, and remove the
        rice. Boil or roast the rice and then beat it into flour.</p>

        <p><b>Description:</b> This shrub grows 60 centimeters to 2.5 meters (24
        inches to 8 feet) high. It has alternate leaves and sharp prickles. Its
        flowers may be red, pink, or yellow. Its fruit, called rose hip, stays
        on the shrub year-round.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> Look for wild roses in dry fields
        and open woods throughout the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> The flowers and buds are edible raw or boiled.
        In an emergency, you can peel and eat the young shoots. You can boil
        fresh, young leaves in water to make a tea. After the flower petals
        fall, eat the rose hips; the pulp is highly nutritious and an excellent
        source of vitamin C. Crush or grind dried rose hips to make flour.</p>

        rootstock may be very large and weigh many kilograms.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> True yams are restricted to tropical
        regions where they are an important food crop. Look for yams in fields,
        clearings, and abandoned gardens. They are found in rain forests,
        semievergreen seasonal forests, and scrub and thorn forests in the
        tropics. In warm temperate areas, they are found in seasonal hardwood or
        mixed hardwood-coniferous forests, as well as some mountainous areas.</p>

        <p><b>Yam bean</b><br>
        <i>Pachyrhizus erosus</i><br>
        <p><b>Description:</b> The yam bean is a climbing plant of the bean
        family, with alternate, three-parted leaves and a turniplike root. The
        bluish or purplish flowers are pealike in shape. The plants are often so
        rampant that they cover the vegetation upon which they are growing.</p>
        <p><b>Habitat and Distribution:</b> The yam bean is native to the
        American tropics, but it was carried by man years ago to Asia and the
        Pacific islands. Now it is commonly cultivated in these places, and is
        also found growing wild in forested areas. This plant grows in wet areas
        of tropical regions.</p>
        <p><b>Edible Parts:</b> The tubers are about the size of a turnip and
        they are crisp, sweet, and juicy with a nutty flavor. They are
        nourishing and thirst quenching. Eat them raw or boiled. To make flour,
        slice the raw tubers, let them dry in the sun, and grind into a flour
        that is high in starch and may be used to thicken soup.</p>
